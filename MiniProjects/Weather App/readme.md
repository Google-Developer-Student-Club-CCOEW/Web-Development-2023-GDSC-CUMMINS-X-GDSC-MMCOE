# Weather App

This project is a Weather App that fetches and displays weather data based on user input, such as a city or location. It provides real-time weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts. This app is designed for developers looking to create a weather application using a weather data API.

## Features

- **Weather Data Retrieval:** Fetch real-time weather data from a weather data API based on user-provided location information.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app offers a user-friendly interface for users to input a city or location and view weather information.

- **Weather Information Display:** Display temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy), and multi-day forecasts for the specified location.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage issues like invalid location input and provide clear error messages to users.

- **API Integration:** Learn how to integrate and utilize a weather data API to obtain accurate and up-to-date weather information.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Development Environment:** Ensure you have a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or another preferred code editor.

- **Weather API Access:** Sign up for access to a weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and obtain an API key.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Open your preferred code editor and load the cloned project folder (`weather-app`).

3. Obtain an API key for the chosen weather data service and replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual key.

### Running the App

1. Start the application in your code editor or run the project using the appropriate development tools.

2. Open a web browser or a testing tool to access the app.

3. Input the desired city or location for which you want to retrieve weather data.

4. The app should fetch weather information from the API and display it on the screen.
