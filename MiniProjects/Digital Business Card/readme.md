# Digital Business Card App

Welcome to the Digital Business Card App, a digital solution to streamline and modernize the exchange of contact information. This project allows you to create your own digital business card, including your contact information, social media links, and a QR code for easy sharing. It's a practical and eco-friendly alternative to traditional paper business cards.

## Features
